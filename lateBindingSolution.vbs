Error Handling:
The most effective way to handle late binding issues is to use error handling. This allows your script to gracefully handle situations where an object or method is not found, preventing the script from crashing.

Example:
```vbscript
On Error Resume Next
Set obj = CreateObject("Some.Unknown.Object")
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
  MsgBox "Object not found: " & Err.Description
  Err.Clear
End If
On Error GoTo 0
```
Alternatively, you could use early binding by explicitly declaring the object type, which requires adding a reference to the type library. This eliminates late-binding issues, but it lacks the flexibility of late binding and may require changes if the object's type library changes.
